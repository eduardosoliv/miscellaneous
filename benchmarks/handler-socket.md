Handler Socket
=============================

Introduction
------------

"HandlerSocket is a MySQL plugin that implements a NoSQL protocol for MySQL. This allows applications to communicate more directly with MySQL storage engines, without the overhead associated with using SQL. This includes operations such as parsing and optimizing queries, as well as table handling operations (opening, locking, unlocking, closing). As a result, using HandlerSocket can provide much better performance for certain applications that using normal SQLapplication protocols."
